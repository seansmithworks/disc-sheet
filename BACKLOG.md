# disc-sheet BACKLOG

## Overnight release-prep run — dispatched 2026-08-31 (Sean asleep; stage only, NO publish)

Plan gate CLOSED: /adversarial-plan ran (Opus refuter, 14 findings, verdict revise); revised plan + unedited refutation in the session scratchpad, ledger to be copied into MORNING.md. Plan B secured: unscoped `disc-sheet` available on npm (404, checked tonight).

- [x] Phase 0a — push feat/customization-parity to origin (done 2026-08-31, upstream set)
- [x] Phase 0b — fresh baseline: vitest 15/15, Playwright 54/54 (43 geometry + 11 a11y)
- [x] Phase 1 — build system + metadata + THE GATE: vite lib build (ESM + d.ts, vite-plugin-lib-inject-css per F1, NODE_ENV define-passthrough per F2), exports dist-only (F3/F12), publishConfig access public (F6), prepublishOnly + dist gitignored (F7), audit >=10-token guard (F11), README rewrite; gate = pack tarball → fresh Next app → next build + prod Playwright + dev-warning check (DONE 80385d7: all green, dist 24.3kB+2.95kB css, 15/54/PASS)
- [x] Phase 2 — npx copy-in: zero-dep bin/disc-sheet.mjs `add`, tested in the same Next consumer, tsc green there, css-modules.d.ts collision handled (F8) (DONE 129a4a1: 18 files land, conflict guard works, consumer tsc+build green)
- [ ] Phase 3 — flagship example (wave 5, unheld by Sean 2026-08-31): example/flagship.html second entry; tokens from README table not stale §2 (F4); floor per F9 = palette + portrait + copy/actions + CloseMask + reduced-motion, cuts stated; example/main.tsx untouched (geometry-gate substrate)
- [ ] Phase 4 — experience audit ("no shitty experiences"): ONE combined design-review + emil-design-eng pass (trimmed per F13), captures (morph, six anchors, reduced-motion, 390x844); mechanical fixes applied, taste calls parked below
- [ ] Phase 5 — ce-code-review on full diff, evidence walk, MORNING.md handoff, final push

## Waiting on Sean (morning)

- [ ] `npm login` then `npm publish --access public` (token expired 2026-08-31, verified 401)
- [ ] Merge feat/customization-parity → main
- [ ] Review flagship captures + parked taste calls (added by Phase 4)
- [ ] `/model` default is now Fable 5 for ALL new sessions (saved by tonight's `/model fable`) — re-pick daily default per your own escalation-only rule

## Parked (off-objective, noticed tonight)

- example/ `evidence/` dir + untracked test-results/ hygiene beyond gitignore
- Site-side cutover (seansmithdesign.com consuming the package) — wave 5's other half, separate run
